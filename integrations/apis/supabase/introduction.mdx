    The [Management API](https://supabase.com/docs/reference/api/introduction)
    is used to manage your Supabase organization, projects, and databases. It
    can also be used to trigger jobs based on changes in your Supabase database.
    Works with OAuth or Personal Access Tokens.

    Wraps the [@supabase/supabase-js](https://github.com/supabase/supabase-js)
    client to make it easy to use Supabase in your jobs to run queries against
    your database and access other functionality, like auth, storage, and
    functions. Works with your Supabase
    [service_role](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/api/api-keys#the-servicerole-key)
    key.
