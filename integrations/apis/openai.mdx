title: Introduction

Trigger.dev provides seamless integration with OpenAI, enabling developers to harness the power of AI 
language models in their serverless applications. With Trigger.dev's background tasks, long-running 
OpenAI completions become possible, even within the constraints of serverless timeouts.

<Snippet file="integration-getting-started.mdx" />

## Installation

To get started with the OpenAI integration on Trigger.dev, you need to install the @trigger.dev/openai package. 
You can do this using npm, pnpm, or yarn:


<CodeGroup>

```bash npm
npm install @trigger.dev/openai@latest
```

```bash pnpm
pnpm install @trigger.dev/openai@latest
```

```bash yarn
yarn add @trigger.dev/openai@latest
```

</CodeGroup>

## Authentication

To use the OpenAI API with Trigger.dev, you'll need an API Key from OpenAI. 
If you don't have one yet, you can obtain it from the OpenAI dashboard.

```ts
import { OpenAI } from "@trigger.dev/openai";

const openai = new OpenAI({
  id: "openai",
  apiKey: process.env.OPENAI_API_KEY!,
});
```

## Example
#1 Generate a joke
 Here's an example of how to use the OpenAI integration in a Trigger.dev job.
 In this example, we'll create a background task to generate a programming joke.

```ts
new Job(client, {
  id: "openai-tasks",
  name: "OpenAI Tasks",
  version: "0.0.1",
  trigger: eventTrigger({
    name: "openai.tasks",
    schema: z.object({}),
  }),
  integrations: {
    openai,
  },
  run: async (payload, io, ctx) => {
    const response = await io.openai.backgroundCreateChatCompletion(
      "background-chat-completion",
      {
        model: "gpt-3.5-turbo",
        messages: [
          {
            role: "user",
            content: "Create a good programming joke about background jobs",
          },
        ],
      }
    );

    await io.logger.info("choices", response.choices);
  },
});
```
#2  Generate Code Snippets
In this example, we'll leverage Trigger.dev's background task to generate code snippets for
 a given programming task:

 ```ts
new Job(client, {
  id: "openai-tasks",
  name: "OpenAI Tasks",
  version: "0.0.1",
  trigger: eventTrigger({
    name: "openai.tasks",
    schema: z.object({}),
  }),
  integrations: {
    openai,
  },
  run: async (payload, io, ctx) => {
    const programmingTask = `Create a function that checks if a string is a palindrome.`;

    const response = await io.openai.backgroundCreateCompletion("background-completion", {
      model: "gpt-3.5-turbo",
      prompt: `Coding task: ${programmingTask}\n\n`,
    });

    await io.logger.info("codeSnippet", response.choices[0]?.text);
  },
});

 ```
#3 Summarize Text
We'll use Trigger.dev's background task to summarize a lengthy article:

```ts
new Job(client, {
  id: "openai-tasks",
  name: "OpenAI Tasks",
  version: "0.0.1",
  trigger: eventTrigger({
    name: "openai.tasks",
    schema: z.object({}),
  }),
  integrations: {
    openai,
  },
  run: async (payload, io, ctx) => {
    const articleToSummarize = `Lorem ipsum. olor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit. 
    Sed nec aliquet sapien. Pellentesque vitae nisi id purus luctus tincidunt. 
    Proin condimentum malesuada turpis, eget tincidunt mauris viverra in.`;

    const response = await io.openai.backgroundCreateCompletion("background-completion", {
      model: "gpt-3.5-turbo",
      prompt: `Please summarize the following article:\n\n${articleToSummarize}`,
    });

    await io.logger.info("summary", response.choices[0]?.text);
  },
});

```
#4 Draft Email Response
we'll use Trigger.dev's background task to draft an email response based on a given email content:

ts```
new Job(client, {
  id: "openai-tasks",
  name: "OpenAI Tasks",
  version: "0.0.1",
  trigger: eventTrigger({
    name: "openai.tasks",
    schema: z.object({}),
  }),
  integrations: {
    openai,
  },
  run: async (payload, io, ctx) => {
    const emailContent = `Dear John,

    Thank you for your inquiry. We appreciate your interest in our products. 
    I have reviewed your request, and I'm pleased to inform you that we can 
    accommodate your requirements. Please find the attached proposal for your 
    reference. If you have any further questions, feel free to ask.

    Best regards,
    Jane Doe`;

    const response = await io.openai.backgroundCreateChatCompletion("background-chat-completion", {
      model: "gpt-3.5-turbo",
      messages: [
        {
          role: "user",
          content: emailContent,
        },
        {
          role: "assistant",
          content: "Draft a suitable response to the email above.",
        },
      ],
    });

    await io.logger.info("draftedEmailResponse", response.choices[0]?.text);
  },
});

```

## Tasks

Tasks that are marked as "long-running" can last longer than your serverless timeout – they are performed on one of our background workers.
